	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>A poached egg is a kind of egg that has been cooked, outside the shell, by poaching (or sometimes steaming), as opposed to simmering or boiling.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 large egg </li>
		<li>1 tablespoon white vinegar </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Fill a large pot with at least 3 inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce temperature to low--the water is ready when you see bubbles at the bottom of the pot, but there should be no bubbles breaking the surface of the water.
        </li>
		<li>Crack egg into a small-mesh sieve, allow it to drain, and then transfer the egg to a small bowl or ramekin in order to avoid a runny egg white. This step will give you a better-shaped poached egg with tighter whites.
        </li>
		<li>When water is at the right temperature, stir in about 1 tablespoon white vinegar which helps the egg white coagulate. Using a spoon, swirl the water in the center of the pot into a vortex or whirlpool, and carefully add egg to the center. Cook until egg white is set, but the yolk is still soft and runny, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Do not overcook.
        </li>
		<li>Transfer the egg to a paper towel to remove excess water using a slotted spoon. Serve immediately.
        </li>
